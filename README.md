# FastAPI Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome! This repository documents my journey to master **FastAPI**. As someone with a background in **AI/ML**, I am committed to learning FastAPI thoroughly to enhance my backend development skills and improve my prospects for placements.

## Why FastAPI?

- FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- It is easy to use, intuitive, and ideal for integrating with AI/ML models and data pipelines.

## Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of FastAPI.
- Build robust APIs for AI/ML applications.
- Prepare for technical interviews and placements with hands-on backend experience.

## Current Progress

- Implemented basic routes and dynamic routing in [main.py](main.py).
- Exploring request handling, response models, and more.

## How to Run

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (already set up as `fastapi-venv/`).
2. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:
    ```sh
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```
3. Start the server:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
